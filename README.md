# Chess-Bot
Welcome to my small project creating a chess AI in python using Jupyter Notebooks!
Inside the notebook, you'll find 5 levels of AI that I've implemented so far.
Feel free to play around with the code and improve/build on it!
This code is featured on my youtube video on this topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z0xZFJoJ9U

## Level 1
AI that makes random moves from the move list.

## Level 2
AI that makes random moves but priotitises captures.

## Level 3
AI that uses the minimax search algorithm and simple tallying evaluation function.
What happens to the search time when you increase the depth further and further?

## Level 4
We improve on level 3 by using Alpha-Beta pruning. Makes the recursion much more efficient.

## Level 4.5
We also try to use Quiescence Search to resolve the horizon issue.
Unfortunately this leads to a huge time increase but I'm hoping to solve this in the future.

Thanks for reading!
